Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository explores the critical process of requirement analysis in software development. It serves as a learning resource and documentation hub for understanding how to gather, document, and manage software requirements effectively. The goal is to ensure that software systems meet stakeholder needs by clearly defining functional and non-functional requirements before development begins.


What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a proposed software system. The objective is to ensure that developers, designers, testers, and clients have a shared understanding of what the system must do and how it should behave.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis:
Elicitation: Collecting requirements through interviews, questionnaires, workshops, observations, and document analysis.

Analysis: Reviewing and prioritizing the requirements to ensure clarity, consistency, and completeness.

Specification: Documenting the requirements formally, often in the form of Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents.

Validation: Ensuring the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible for implementation.

Management: Tracking changes and maintaining consistency as the project evolves.

Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):
Foundation for Development: It sets the direction for design, development, and testing by defining what the software should achieve.

Reduces Errors and Rework: Well-defined requirements minimize misunderstandings and reduce costly fixes later in the development process.

Improves Communication: Acts as a communication bridge between stakeholders (clients, users) and the technical team.

Ensures Stakeholder Satisfaction: Helps ensure that the final product meets user needs and business goals.

Supports Project Planning: Enables better estimation of time, cost, and resources needed for the project.
